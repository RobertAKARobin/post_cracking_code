# Notes

- "Learning the language" is where most people seem to think programming stops. This is like thinking you memorize the Spanish dictionary and then you can speak Spanish.
- Learning code isn't like learning piano where if you just mindlessly do it long enough you get better.
  - Tutorials and sites like CodeAcademy don't seem to "stick". You need an actual project.
- "Hello world" examples are only useful if you see them as a means to an end, rather than an end in and of themselves.
- Learning to code requires two things:
  - Not being afraid of your computer
    - Learning a language is usually very easy. The hard part is getting it installed, learning the IDE, using the command line in the first place, and *seeing how the pieces all fit together*
  - Having something to create
    - Coming up with motivating ideas is really hard. People tend to think they should do things they really *enjoy*, when things that frustrate them provide much more motivation

- Programmers are lazy and have bad memories
  - Programming is all about laziness: some process -- whether on a computer or in real life -- is inefficient, and you write something to automate part of it.
    - If a programmer doesn't "get" your code in about 3 seconds, they'll think it's bad
  - Google is your memory, and that's **OK**

- Learning to code is different from other types of learning
  - Students tend to feel like they're not getting their money's worth if they're not getting lectured at, but lecture is one of the worst ways to teach code
  - The aim of college is to graduate and get a degree. The aim of a boot camp is to give you a portfolio.
    - You can't just tick boxes and pass tests and BS and be a programmer
    - Really hard to get students to **not** be all hung up on "graduating"
      - Always want to know what the "right answer" is for homework assignments
  - The fundamental test of whether or not you're a good programmer is, "Does your code work?"

- Standardization of learning
  - All GA campuses teach different things in different ways
  - The biggest attempt to standardize was creating a curriculum with lesson plans from which all instructors were expected to draw; the problem was that the instructors all feel very strongly about teaching concepts in their own way
    - Some kind of holisitc assessment, covering what students should know in order to get the GA stamp of approval, would be more useful
    - ...or would it? That stamp of approval is harmful

- The people who teach programming are programmers, not teachers

- "How is it that you always assume you're right?" "I don't, I just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption."

The rumors you've heard about tech jobs -- the high salaries, the flexible hours, the free snacks and energy drinks, the ping-pong tables -- are pretty accurate. The industry tends to be meritocratic, where you're judged on what you actually produce rather than who you know or how long you've been there. There will never be a shortage of programming jobs because someone will just

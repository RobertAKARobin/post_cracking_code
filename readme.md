# Cracking Code

> The learn-to-code industry is big and will get much bigger. The problem is no-one actually knows how to teach code.

Right now, around the world, adults from all walks of life are dropping their careers and paying tens of thousands of dollars to bang their heads against an array of technologies for twelve weeks, five days a week, nine hours a day (plus homework).

Their hope is that this investment will pay off in the form of a career in the high-speed, high-paying, wear-sweatpants-and-play-ping-pong-at-work web development industry.

It's a good investment. For 15 months in Washington, DC, I taught the Web Development Immersive, a coding "boot camp" run by General Assembly (GA). Even though GA makes no guarantee that its students will actually get hired, its graduates land those coveted positions at a rate of over 90% within three months of completing the program.

It's a win-win situation, and web development "boot camps" are springing up all over to cash in.

"Boot camp" means "hard". You can't become a Marine or a soldier without completing boot camp. "Web development boot camp" implies that to be a developer you have to slog through this rite of passage.

But there's a growing elephant in the room: the vast majority of web developers are self-taught, and don't have any formal training at all.

The truth is you don't need a boot camp to be a web developer. You also don't need a fancy computer, expensive software, a computer science degree, or to be good at math. You can design and publish a million-dollar webpage for free from a library computer.

I'm a college drop-out in my twenties. Through GA I was a teacher, mentor, confidant, and life coach to Air Force colonels, licensed doctors, and mechanical engineers, as well as waiters, cashiers, and bartenders. You'd think you could guess who would lead the class based on their background and level of education, but that wasn't the case at all. 

So what makes a programmer? **Whoever finds the recipe to the secret sauce will have the boot camp industry by the horns.**

### The myth of the not-a-computer-person

The easy answer is that I'm a "born programmer", and most people are not. I'd love to have a nickel for every time someone told me,

"Oh, I could never learn to code."

"I'm not a computer person."

"My mind just doesn't work that way."

I've never heard anyone say, "I could never learn to fix a car," or "I could never learn to play the piano," or "I could never learn to write a business proposal. My mind just doesn't work that way." We accept that if we had enough time to work at those we'd eventually get them.

But coding is different. It's on a pedestal. The word "code" even makes you think of secret agents and mysterious messages.

If it's true that some folks are just born with it, it's scary news. Every career is more and more linked to code. If success means coding, and coding means having the right DNA, then most people are doomed at birth. In a hundred years the masses will be competing in the Hunger Games under an inbred technocratic elite.

It's not a happy answer, but it's a simple one, and if you're having trouble learning code you're let off the hook as a victim of genetic circumstance.

I also think it's the wrong answer. **The difference between the coding "haves" and "have-nots" is in how they tried to learn it.**

### The language is the easy part

If you can complete a high school Spanish 101 class, you can learn a programming language. Most spoken languages evolved randomly over hundreds of years. Most programming languages were created in the past couple of decades, and all of them were made by someone sitting down and saying, "I'm going to make a language."

"Learning the language" is where most people seem to think programming stops. This is like thinking you memorize the Spanish dictionary and then you can speak Spanish.

### Programmers need problems


### Coding is hard because we think coding is hard



### Good coders !== good teachers

## Notes

- Learning code isn't like learning piano where if you just mindlessly do it long enough you get better.
  - Tutorials and sites like CodeAcademy don't seem to "stick". You need an actual project.
- "Hello world" examples are only useful if you see them as a means to an end, rather than an end in and of themselves.
- Learning to code requires two things:
  - Not being afraid of your computer
    - Learning a language is usually very easy. The hard part is getting it installed, learning the IDE, using the command line in the first place, and *seeing how the pieces all fit together*
  - Having something to create
    - Coming up with motivating ideas is really hard. People tend to think they should do things they really *enjoy*, when things that frustrate them provide much more motivation

- Programmers are lazy and have bad memories
  - Programming is all about laziness: some process -- whether on a computer or in real life -- is inefficient, and you write something to automate part of it.
    - If a programmer doesn't "get" your code in about 3 seconds, they'll think it's bad
  - Google is your memory, and that's **OK**

- Learning to code is different from other types of learning
  - Students tend to feel like they're not getting their money's worth if they're not getting lectured at, but lecture is one of the worst ways to teach code
  - The aim of college is to graduate and get a degree. The aim of a boot camp is to give you a portfolio.
    - You can't just tick boxes and pass tests and BS and be a programmer
    - Really hard to get students to **not** be all hung up on "graduating"
      - Always want to know what the "right answer" is for homework assignments
  - The fundamental test of whether or not you're a good programmer is, "Does your code work?"

- Standardization of learning
  - All GA campuses teach different things in different ways
  - The biggest attempt to standardize was creating a curriculum with lesson plans from which all instructors were expected to draw; the problem was that the instructors all feel very strongly about teaching concepts in their own way
    - Some kind of holisitc assessment, covering what students should know in order to get the GA stamp of approval, would be more useful
    - ...or would it? That stamp of approval is harmful

- The people who teach programming are programmers, not teachers

- "How is it that you always assume you're right?" "I don't, I just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption."

The rumors you've heard about tech jobs -- the high salaries, the flexible hours, the free snacks and energy drinks, the ping-pong tables -- are pretty accurate. The industry tends to be meritocratic, where you're judged on what you actually produce rather than who you know or how long you've been there. There will never be a shortage of programming jobs because someone will just

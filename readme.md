# Cracking Code

> The learn-to-code industry is big and will get much bigger. The problem is no-one actually knows how to teach code.

"I just feel like I'm not getting it," they say, looking down and biting their lip. "Everyone else is learning so much faster than I am."

"That's a crummy feeling," I respond from across the cafe table, nodding my head over a paper cup of coffee. "It probably doesn't help that you quit your job and sunk $14,000 and 12 weeks into this." They half-smile a yes.

I've played out this same scene about 150 times, even though the 150 people who have sat on the other side of that table have all been of different backgrounds, genders, and ages. 

"Almost all the other students have said they feel the same way. It's not possibile for *everyone* to be behind *everyone else*." I smile. "You're special, but you're not *that* special." They half-laugh, half-sigh.

Several weeks later, with few exceptions, the student completes the program and is offered a well-paying programming job.

I taught the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly (GA), a programming "boot camp", for 15 months in Washington, DC. Right now, at locations around the world, adults from all walks are paying a lot of money to learn about and practice with a barrage of technologies for twelve weeks, five days a week, nine hours a day (plus homework).

Their hope is that this investment will pay off with a career in the high-speed, high-paying web development industry.

It seems to be a pretty good investment: even though GA makes no guarantee that students will actually get hired, its graduates land those coveted positions at a rate of over 90% within three months of completing the program.

These programming "boot camps" are hard. "Boot camp" is synonymous with "hard".

## Notes

- Learning code isn't like learning piano where if you just mindlessly do it long enough you get better.
  - Tutorials and sites like CodeAcademy don't seem to "stick". You need an actual project.
- "Hello world" examples are only useful if you see them as a means to an end, rather than an end in and of themselves.
- Learning to code requires two things:
  - Not being afraid of your computer
    - Learning a language is usually very easy. The hard part is getting it installed, learning the IDE, using the command line in the first place, and *seeing how the pieces all fit together*
  - Having something to create
    - Coming up with motivating ideas is really hard. People tend to think they should do things they really *enjoy*, when things that frustrate them provide much more motivation

- Programmers are lazy and have bad memories
  - Programming is all about laziness: some process -- whether on a computer or in real life -- is inefficient, and you write something to automate part of it.
    - If a programmer doesn't "get" your code in about 3 seconds, they'll think it's bad
  - Google is your memory, and that's **OK**

- Learning to code is different from other types of learning
  - Students tend to feel like they're not getting their money's worth if they're not getting lectured at, but lecture is one of the worst ways to teach code
  - The aim of college is to graduate and get a degree. The aim of a boot camp is to give you a portfolio.
    - You can't just tick boxes and pass tests and BS and be a programmer
    - Really hard to get students to **not** be all hung up on "graduating"
      - Always want to know what the "right answer" is for homework assignments
  - The fundamental test of whether or not you're a good programmer is, "Does your code work?"

- Standardization of learning
  - All GA campuses teach different things in different ways
  - The biggest attempt to standardize was creating a curriculum with lesson plans from which all instructors were expected to draw; the problem was that the instructors all feel very strongly about teaching concepts in their own way
    - Some kind of holisitc assessment, covering what students should know in order to get the GA stamp of approval, would be more useful
    - ...or would it? That stamp of approval is harmful

- The people who teach programming are programmers, not teachers

- "How is it that you always assume you're right?" "I don't, I just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption."

The rumors you've heard about tech jobs -- the high salaries, the flexible hours, the free snacks and energy drinks, the ping-pong tables -- are pretty accurate. The industry tends to be meritocratic, where you're judged on what you actually produce rather than who you know or how long you've been there. There will never be a shortage of programming jobs because someone will just

# Cracking Code

> The learn-to-code industry is big and will get much bigger. The problem is no-one actually knows how to teach code.

"I just feel like I'm not getting it," the grown man said, looking down and biting his lip. "Everyone else is learning so much faster than I am."

"That's a crummy feeling," I responded from across the small table, nodding sympathetically. "And it probably doesn't help that you quit your job and sunk $14,000 and 12 weeks into this." He agreed.

"Almost all the other students have said they feel the same way. It's not possible for *everyone* to be behind *everyone else*." I smiled. "You're special, but you're not *that* special." He half-laughed, half-sighed.

I played out this same scene about 150 times with about 150 different people of all backgrounds, genders, and ages. Most of them were older than me.

Several weeks after this conversation, with few exceptions, the student would complete my programming "boot camp" and be offered a well-paying programming job.

I taught the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly (GA) for 15 months in Washington, DC. Right now, at locations around the world, adults from all walks of life are dropping their careers and paying lots of money to practice with a wide array of technologies for twelve weeks, five days a week, nine hours a day (plus homework).

Their hope is that this investment will pay off in the form of a career in the high-speed, high-paying, wear-whatever-and-play-ping-pong-at-work web development industry.

It seems to be a pretty good investment: even though GA makes no guarantee that students will actually get hired, its graduates land those coveted positions at a rate of over 90% within three months of completing the program.

It's a win-win situation, and "boot camps" are springing up all over to cash in.

These code schools are hard. "Boot camp" is synonymous with "hard".

But there's a growing elephant in the room that could pull the rug out from beneath the entire industry: the vast majority of programmers never went to boot camp. They never had any formal training at all. They just learned on their own.

Here I am, a 27-year-old college drop-out, teaching, coaching, and comforting Air Force colonels and licensed doctors. What makes me a "have" and them "have-nots"?

### The myth of the not-a-computer-person

The simple answer is that I'm a "born programmer". As a society, we really like this idea. We put programmers on a pedestal. People say,

"Oh, I'm not a computer person."

"I could never learn to code."

"My mind just doesn't work that way."

I've never heard anyone say, "I could never learn to fix a car," or "I could never learn to play the piano," or "I could never learn to write a business proposal. My mind just doesn't work that way." We accept that if we had the time to work at those long enough we'd eventually get them.

But coding is different. It's unattainable. The word "code" even makes you think of secret agents and mysterious messages.

**If this is true -- that some folks are just born with it -- it's scary news.** Every career and industry is more and more linked to code. If being successful means being able to code, and being able to code means having the right DNA, then most people are doomed at birth. A hundred years from now the ignorant masses will be competing in the Hunger Games under an inbred technocratic elite.

I think this is bogus. On my watch, no-one gets the luxury of being a victim of circumstance.

## Notes

- Learning code isn't like learning piano where if you just mindlessly do it long enough you get better.
  - Tutorials and sites like CodeAcademy don't seem to "stick". You need an actual project.
- "Hello world" examples are only useful if you see them as a means to an end, rather than an end in and of themselves.
- Learning to code requires two things:
  - Not being afraid of your computer
    - Learning a language is usually very easy. The hard part is getting it installed, learning the IDE, using the command line in the first place, and *seeing how the pieces all fit together*
  - Having something to create
    - Coming up with motivating ideas is really hard. People tend to think they should do things they really *enjoy*, when things that frustrate them provide much more motivation

- Programmers are lazy and have bad memories
  - Programming is all about laziness: some process -- whether on a computer or in real life -- is inefficient, and you write something to automate part of it.
    - If a programmer doesn't "get" your code in about 3 seconds, they'll think it's bad
  - Google is your memory, and that's **OK**

- Learning to code is different from other types of learning
  - Students tend to feel like they're not getting their money's worth if they're not getting lectured at, but lecture is one of the worst ways to teach code
  - The aim of college is to graduate and get a degree. The aim of a boot camp is to give you a portfolio.
    - You can't just tick boxes and pass tests and BS and be a programmer
    - Really hard to get students to **not** be all hung up on "graduating"
      - Always want to know what the "right answer" is for homework assignments
  - The fundamental test of whether or not you're a good programmer is, "Does your code work?"

- Standardization of learning
  - All GA campuses teach different things in different ways
  - The biggest attempt to standardize was creating a curriculum with lesson plans from which all instructors were expected to draw; the problem was that the instructors all feel very strongly about teaching concepts in their own way
    - Some kind of holisitc assessment, covering what students should know in order to get the GA stamp of approval, would be more useful
    - ...or would it? That stamp of approval is harmful

- The people who teach programming are programmers, not teachers

- "How is it that you always assume you're right?" "I don't, I just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption."

The rumors you've heard about tech jobs -- the high salaries, the flexible hours, the free snacks and energy drinks, the ping-pong tables -- are pretty accurate. The industry tends to be meritocratic, where you're judged on what you actually produce rather than who you know or how long you've been there. There will never be a shortage of programming jobs because someone will just

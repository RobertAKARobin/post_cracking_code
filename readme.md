# Why learning to code is hard

> It's not for the reasons you think.

"I could never learn to code."

"I'm not a computer person."

"My mind just doesn't work that way."

I'd love a nickel for every time someone said that.

On the other hand, I've never heard anyone say, "I could never learn to fix a car," or "I could never learn to play the piano," or "I could never learn to write a business proposal. My mind just doesn't work that way." Most things, we figure if you work at them long enough you'll get them.

Coding seems different. It's up on a pedestal for a special kind of person. The word "code" even makes you think of spies and secret societies.

If it's true that programmers are born that way, it's scary news. Every career is now linked to code. If success means coding, and coding means having the right DNA, then in a hundred years the masses will be competing in the Hunger Games under an inbred techno-elite.

Fortunately this is baloney. Anyone can code. You don't need a fancy computer, expensive software, a computer science degree, or to be good at math. You don't need a single programming book. You can design and publish a million-dollar webpage for free from a library computer.

If learning to code is hard, it's because we don't know how to teach it. (My book, "Learn some code in about two hours without a computer," aims to change that.)

## Programming boot camp

For 15 months in Washington, DC, I taught the Web Development Immersive, a coding "boot camp" run by General Assembly (GA).

GA's students -- cashiers, bartenders, orthodox Jewish grandmothers, licensed doctors, Air Force colonels, and everyone in between -- drop their careers to pay tens of thousands of dollars to bang their heads against an array of technologies for twelve weeks, five days a week, nine hours a day (plus homework).

Their hope is that this investment will pay off in the form of a career in the high-speed, high-paying, wear-sweatpants-and-play-ping-pong-at-work web development industry.

It's a good investment. Even though GA makes no guarantee that its students will actually get hired, its graduates land those coveted positions at a rate of over 90% within three months of completing the program.

It's a win-win situation, and boot camps are springing up all over to cash in.

You can't become a Marine or a soldier without going through boot camp. Web development "boot camps" imply the same is true of developers.

The elephant in the room is that a huge number of web developers are self-taught and have no formal training at all.

So what's the difference between the person who is self-taught, the person who pays for a boot camp, and the person who says "My mind just doesn't work that way"?

## Up-at-night problems

Everyone I know with any interest in code has tried CodeAcademy's free online web design tutorial. I can count on zero fingers how many really retained anything from it.

Like most learn-to-code books and tutorials, it follows this order:

1. This is how the Web works.
2. This is how you make "Hello, world!" show up on a webpage.
3. Here are 30 HTML tags to practice.
4. This is how you make "Hello, world!" look pretty.
5. Here are 30 CSS properties to practice.

For comparison, here's the order of a popular Spanish textbook:

1. Here are 30 nouns and adjectives, the days of the week, and the seasons.
2. This is how you say, "*This* is *that*."
3. Here are 30 regular verbs to practice.
4. Here are 30 irregular verbs to practice.
5. Here are 5 different tenses to practice.

This order makes sense. It's logical. But you won't finish the textbook knowing how to speak Spanish, and you won't finish CodeAcademy knowing how to code.

"Hello, world" works only if you know how you're going to use it. You need an "up-at-night" problem: a puzzle where making a specific website or program is the only way you'll be able to stop staying up all night thinking about it.

The best way to learn Spanish is to be immersed in an environment where you *have* to speak it to get by. Memorizing is helpful only if you can *do* something with those nouns.

> (The up-at-night problem that got me into coding was discovering I was too shy to sell things in-person or over the phone, but still had to pay rent. I thought having a simple website would let me avoid interacting with real people, and couldn't afford to hire a designer to make it for me.)

Having a cool app idea, or wanting to make more to support a family, or wanting to be a better project manager are all great reasons to get interested in coding. But they're not problems that can be solved *only* by learning how to code.

**Programming is the art of creating small shortcuts**. Something slow or unpleasant to use keeps you up at night -- a bloated Excel spreadsheet, a repetitive task, an uncomfortable interaction -- and you do just enough to grease that wheel.

## It's not you; it's me

Coders are not necessarily the best people to teach coding. For example:

> "Hello, world" helps Self-taught Steve solve his up-at-night problem. So, he expects everyone else to find it helpful. With the best intentions he publishes a "Hello, world" tutorial. All his experienced programmer friends -- who also used "Hello, world" tutorials -- review it, and tell him it's great.

> His dad, wanting to be supportive and having a passing interest in technology, completes it. But he never goes beyond that tutorial to actually create a website. Steve concludes he's too old or too not-a-computer-person to learn code on his own.

This is hogwash. If you can learn English, you can learn code. English evolved randomly over thousands of years, and it shows. Programming languages on the other hand were all made in the last 60 years by someone sitting down and saying, "I'm going to make a language."

So what do you do if you *want* to learn code but don't have the "need" of an up-at-night problem?

### 1. Create the need.

If you want to learn web development, create a website for yourself. With this solid, concrete goal, following the steps on CodeAcademy will be helpful. Then, **show it to other people**. It will be really ugly. You won't want to feel embarrassed. There's your up-at-night problem.

### 2. Take a class.

Coding students new to a boot camp tend to feel like they're not getting their money's worth unless they're getting 4 hours of lecture a day.

Really, the two major advantages of boot camp are, first, that you can usually get questions answered more quickly than you could on your own, and second, that there's a teacher breathing down your neck. You *need* to learn and produce results, or you'll feel bad.

These are **huge** advantages. A class creates the up-at-night problem for you.

### 3. Learn some code in about two hours without a computer.

Every programming book assumes you already have an up-at-night problem. They tell you *how* to write code, but they don't tell you *why* you might be interested in the first place. So, someone curious about code picks up a book, flips through a few pages, and finds:

- It looks really boring.
- It looks really complicated.
- It looks really long.
- They need a computer to do anything.

Their curiosity goes *poof*, and they turn into a "not-a-computer-person".

My book, "Learn some code in about two hours without a computer", is for people who are just curious. **It's specifically *not* for people who already know programming.**

Instead of telling you *how* to code, it's full of fill-in-the-blanks and multiple-choice questions that you solve to explore *why* code is the way it is. It's all common sense; no big computer knowledge necessary.

A good chunk of the book is already available online for free. To write the rest, I've launched a Kickstarter. If you're curious, take a look, and let me know what you think!

My hope is that publishing this for cheap will make coding accessible to all the people who would otherwise write themselves off as not-computer-people, or would think they couldn't afford to learn.

**Coding is the future.** How to make it a future for *everyone* is a tough nut to crack -- but, I think, a crackable one.

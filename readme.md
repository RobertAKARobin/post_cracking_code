# Cracking Code

> The learn-to-code industry is big and will get much bigger. The problem is no-one actually knows how to teach code.

Right now, around the world, adults from all walks of life are dropping their careers and paying tens of thousands of dollars to bang their heads against an array of technologies for twelve weeks, five days a week, nine hours a day (plus homework).

Their hope is that this investment will pay off in the form of a career in the high-speed, high-paying, wear-sweatpants-and-play-ping-pong-at-work web development industry.

It's a good investment. For 15 months in Washington, DC, I taught the Web Development Immersive, a coding "boot camp" run by General Assembly (GA). Even though GA makes no guarantee that its students will actually get hired, its graduates land those coveted positions at a rate of over 90% within three months of completing the program.

It's a win-win situation, and other boot camps are springing up all over to cash in.

You can't become a Marine or a soldier without completing boot camp. Web development "boot camps" imply the same is true of developers.

But there's a growing elephant in the room: a huge number of web developers are self-taught and have no formal training at all.

The truth is you don't need a boot camp to be a web developer. You also don't need a fancy computer, expensive software, a computer science degree, or to be good at math. You can design and publish a million-dollar webpage for free from a library computer.

So what's the difference between the person who is self-taught, and the person who pays $14,000 for what they could learn for free?

## The myth of the not-a-computer person

I'm a college drop-out in my twenties, and I'm self-taught. My students were cashiers, bartenders, orthodox Jewish grandmothers, licensed doctors, Air Force colonels, and everyone in between.

The easy explanation is that I'm a "born programmer", and most people aren't. I'd love to get a nickel for every time someone told me,

"Oh, I could never learn to code."

"I'm not a computer person."

"My mind just doesn't work that way."

On the other hand, I've never heard anyone say, "I could never learn to fix a car," or "I could never learn to play the piano," or "I could never learn to write a business proposal. My mind just doesn't work that way." It's accepted that if you work long enough at those you'll get them.

We think coding is different. It's up on a pedestal. The word "code" even makes you think of secret agents and mysterious messages.

If it's true that some folks are just born with it, it's scary news. Every career is more and more linked to code. If success means coding, and coding means having the right DNA, then in a hundred years the masses will be competing in the Hunger Games under an inbred technocratic elite.

Really, if you can learn English, you can learn a programming language. English evolved randomly over thousands of years. Programming languages were all created in the last 60 years by someone sitting down and saying, "I'm going to make a language."

The difference isn't in how "smart" you are. It's not even in how much discipline you have: my students were all incredibly hard-working. **The difference is in why you learn to code in the first place.**

### Programmers need problems

There are two types of people who learn to code:

1. The people who have some technical or mechanical problem or puzzle that keeps them up at night, and writing a program or script seems like the only way they'll be able to solve it and actually get some sleep.

2. Everyone else.

I started learning code because I was too shy to sell things in-person or over the phone. Instead of just sucking it up, I thought selling things online would let me avoid interacting with real people, and I was too cheap and stubborn to pay someone to make a website for me.

Coding boot camp students might be motivated by having a business idea, or wanting to make more to support their families, or liking to build stuff. But these aren't really what code is meant for.

**Programming is creating small shortcuts**. You have something that's slow or unpleasant to use -- a bloated Excel spreadsheet, a repetitive task, an uncomfortable interaction -- and you do just enough to solve that very specific problem.

### Coding books are boring

Programmers are notorious for being "lazy": when faced with something inefficient or annoying, they work extremely hard to avoid having to deal with it. Without this kind of problem, learning code on your own is almost impossible.

This is why coding books and online coding tutorials never really seem to "stick" with beginners.

Everyone I know with any interest in code has tried CodeAcademy's free online web design tutorial. But I can count on zero fingers the number of people who have really retained anything from it.

CodeAcademy isn't *bad*, but it assumes you're using it as a means to an end: you already have a problem you want to solve, and you're using CodeAcademy to get there. 

Learn-to-code resources tend to follow the same order:

1. This is how the Web works.
- This is how you make "Hello, world!" show up on a webpage.
- Here are 30 HTML tags to practice.
- This is how you make "Hello, world!" look pretty.
- Here are 30 CSS properties to practice.
- This is how you make "Hello, world!" change colors when you click on it.
- Here are 30 Javascript functions to practice.

## Notes

- "Learning the language" is where most people seem to think programming stops. This is like thinking you memorize the Spanish dictionary and then you can speak Spanish.
- Learning code isn't like learning piano where if you just mindlessly do it long enough you get better.
  - Tutorials and sites like CodeAcademy don't seem to "stick". You need an actual project.
- "Hello world" examples are only useful if you see them as a means to an end, rather than an end in and of themselves.
- Learning to code requires two things:
  - Not being afraid of your computer
    - Learning a language is usually very easy. The hard part is getting it installed, learning the IDE, using the command line in the first place, and *seeing how the pieces all fit together*
  - Having something to create
    - Coming up with motivating ideas is really hard. People tend to think they should do things they really *enjoy*, when things that frustrate them provide much more motivation

- Programmers are lazy and have bad memories
  - Programming is all about laziness: some process -- whether on a computer or in real life -- is inefficient, and you write something to automate part of it.
    - If a programmer doesn't "get" your code in about 3 seconds, they'll think it's bad
  - Google is your memory, and that's **OK**

- Learning to code is different from other types of learning
  - Students tend to feel like they're not getting their money's worth if they're not getting lectured at, but lecture is one of the worst ways to teach code
  - The aim of college is to graduate and get a degree. The aim of a boot camp is to give you a portfolio.
    - You can't just tick boxes and pass tests and BS and be a programmer
    - Really hard to get students to **not** be all hung up on "graduating"
      - Always want to know what the "right answer" is for homework assignments
  - The fundamental test of whether or not you're a good programmer is, "Does your code work?"

- Standardization of learning
  - All GA campuses teach different things in different ways
  - The biggest attempt to standardize was creating a curriculum with lesson plans from which all instructors were expected to draw; the problem was that the instructors all feel very strongly about teaching concepts in their own way
    - Some kind of holisitc assessment, covering what students should know in order to get the GA stamp of approval, would be more useful
    - ...or would it? That stamp of approval is harmful

- The people who teach programming are programmers, not teachers

- "How is it that you always assume you're right?" "I don't, I just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption."

The rumors you've heard about tech jobs -- the high salaries, the flexible hours, the free snacks and energy drinks, the ping-pong tables -- are pretty accurate. The industry tends to be meritocratic, where you're judged on what you actually produce rather than who you know or how long you've been there. There will never be a shortage of programming jobs because someone will just
